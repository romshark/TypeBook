# TypeBook

TypeBook is a [static site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page)
generator for data structure and relation documentations.
It takes a user-written [YAML](http://yaml.org/) encoded descriptions
of an arbitrary type system, checks it for errors and finally turns it into
a navigable, easy to consume, styled and portable HTML document.
